## Heatmap of the prevalence of bad mental health in U.S.

```{r heatmap, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
state_stat <- read_csv("data/state_stat.csv")

plot_usmap(data = state_stat, values = "mean_crd") +
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "white", high = "red", name = "Crude Prevalence (2016)"
    )
```

From this map we can see that people in Hawaii possess the best mental health, while people in the Great Lakes region suffer from a relatively worse mental health. The highest prevalence of bad mental health is in Ohio, which is about 65 percent more than that of Hawaii.
