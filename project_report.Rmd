## Motivation

### Basic Knowlegde about Mental Health

 - Mental health is an important component of overall health.
 - Can increases the risk for many types of physical health problems.
 - Presence of chronic physical health problems can also increase the risk for mental health problems.
 - Over 45 million Americans - almost 20% - are experiencing a mental illness. 57% of adults with a mental illness receive no treatment.

### Goals of project

 - Understanding the risk factors for bad mental health
 
 - Visualizing correlation of the risk factors and bad mental health
 
 - visualizing the distribution of risk factors and bad mental health prevalence across United States.
 
 - Giving suggestions about reducing prevelance of bad mental health

## Questions

We tried to figure out the possible causes of bad mental health or mental health illness. We were also interested in visualizing the distribution of risk factors and mental illness prevalence prevalence in the United states, by state and by cities. In addition, we also sought to figure out the correlations between bad mental health and chronic disease and bad living behaviors. As a result, the questions were as followed:

  - What are the risk factors of bad mental health? What are the correlations between the outcome and the factors? How to visualize them?
  
  - What are the distributions of bad mental health and risk factors in different states and cities in the United States? How to visualize them?
  
  - Are there any ways for us to reduce the prevalence of bad mental health?

## Analysis 

To make inferences of the relationships between mental health and five variables including obesity, diabetes, drinking, cancer and sleeping which represent the mean prevalence in each cities in the United States in our dataset, we build five linear regression models and plot them. Based on the observations from the five regression models, diabetes and obesity have positive association with mental health. For diabetes, we can see from the plot that there is an positive linear relationship and the regression model is $Y = 0.5985X + 6.7551$. As for the obesity, we can also see a salient positive relationship and the linear regression model is $Y = 0.26779X + 4.97108$. The positive relationships of diabetes and mental health and obesity and mental health implies that people who with obesity and diabetes are more likely to have mental health issues. The sleeping variable in our model and plot represents the prevalence of sleeping less than 7 hours, we can see a positive linear relationship between mental health and sleeping which means the cities with more people sleeping less than 7 hours will be more likely to have mental health issues. And the model is $Y_i = 0.33366X + 1.00842$  

However, from the plots of drinking and cancer, we can see a slightly negative relationship. To test if the negative relationship between mental health and drinking is significant or not, we perform a t-test: By using 0.05 significance level, p-value is less than 2e-16, so we can conclude that the negative relationship between mental health and drinking is significant and the regression model is $Y = -0.30765X + 0.03355$. For the relationship between mental health and cancer, p-value is 0.00149 < 0.05 so we can also conclude that the negative relationship is significant.
